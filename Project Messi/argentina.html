                <h2>Copa América final</h2>
                As Messi evolved into one of the best players in the world, he secured a place in Alfio Basile's starting line-up,
                as part of a team considered favourites to win the 2007 Copa América, held in Venezuela. He set up the game-winning
                goal of their 4–1 victory over the United States in the opening match, before winning a penalty that led to the game-tying
                first strike of their 4–2 win in the next match against Colombia.As they had secured their place in the knockout phase,
                Messi started the next game on the bench, coming on in the last 25 minutes with the score at 0–0 to help his team defeat Paraguay
                by assisting their only goal. At the quarter-final stage, where the group winners faced Peru, he scored the second goal of a 4–0
                victory that saw them through to the semi-final, during which he chipped the ball over Mexico's goalkeeper to ensure another 3–0 win.
                In a surprise defeat, Argentina lost the final 3–0 to a Brazil squad that lacked several of the nation's best players.
                 <br> <br>
                Their unexpected loss was followed by much criticism in Argentina, though Messi was mostly exempt due to his young age and secondary
                 status to star player Juan Román Riquelme.He was named the best young player of the tournament by CONMEBOL.

              <h2>Olympic Gold 2008</h2>
              Ahead of the 2008 Summer Olympics, Barcelona legally barred Messi from representing Argentina at the tournament as
              it coincided with their Champions League qualifying matches.After interference from newly appointed Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola,
              who had won the tournament in 1992, Messi was permitted to join Sergio Batista's under-23 squad in Beijing.During the first match,
              he scored the opening goal and assisted another in their 2–1 victory over the Ivory Coast. <br> <br>
              Following a 1–0 win in the next group
              match against Australia, ensuring their quarter-final qualification, Messi was rested during the game against Serbia, while his side
              won the match to finish first in their group. Against the Netherlands, he again scored the first goal and assisted a second strike
              to help his team to a 2–1 win in extra time. <br> <br>
              After a 3–0 semi-final victory over Brazil, Messi assisted the only goal in the final
              as Argentina defeated Nigeria to claim Olympic gold medals.Along with Riquelme, Messi was singled out by FIFA as the stand-out
              player from the tournament's best team.
